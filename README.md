Hi, Let me introduce myself first My name is *Kate*, I am learning at **Newton sixth form** in Year 9. Let's talk about my most favorite subject is CS50 HARVARD and ICT.
I am very sad that this semester I don't get learn ICT but it's ok I get to learn comsci instead. Everyone think that CS50 is very ~~easy~~. ***NO!*** , It is very hard,**EXTREMELY HARD**. 
Sometimes one task takes me around one hour,
######
<sub>I mean more than one hour</sub>

<sup>More than a day!! HEHE</sup>

When you going to learn CS50 

> I recommed you to learn basic coding first.
> This will help you a lot :)

Three words that I want to tell you when you are going to learn CS50
```

Give 
Up
